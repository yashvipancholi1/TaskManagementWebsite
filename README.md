# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Task Management System

A secure and dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system designed for efficient **Task Management**. This project provides an intuitive **Admin Dashboard** for managing users, roles, and permissions, ensuring users can only access and modify data based on their assigned roles and permissions.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This system implements a **Task Management Platform** with role-based access and permissions, featuring:

- **User Authentication**:
  - Secure **Sign-Up** and **Login** functionality.
  - Users can access the platform based on their **Active/Inactive** status.

- **Task List Access**:
  - Users with **Read** permission can view the Task List but cannot modify it.
  - Users with **Write** permission can view and make changes to the Task List.

- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Administrators have access to a comprehensive dashboard for:
    - Viewing all registered users.
    - Managing user roles, permissions, and statuses (Active/Inactive).
    - Adding or removing users from the system.
    - Modifying permissions dynamically.

- **Role Management**:
  - Define and edit roles.
  - Assign or revoke permissions (e.g., Read, Write) for each role.

- **Mock API with JSON Server**:
  - Simulated backend for handling CRUD operations on:
    - **Users**: Add, edit, delete, and assign roles.
    - **Tasks**: Manage task-related operations.
  - Enables realistic server responses to validate frontend functionality.
